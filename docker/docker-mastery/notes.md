# Docker mastery course

## Online chat

Get more out of this course by getting live help from myself and other students. I've setup a Slack Chat Team that you can join at chat.bretfisher.com

Slack is a fantastic private, persistent chat product that I use in so many of the communities I'm in and thought it would be a great way for extending this course and adding more value to your learning. It comes with clients for all desktop and mobile OS's and also works in the browser.

General Steps:

    Go to chat.bretfisher.com and give it your email address.

    You will be sent an email from Slack, with an invite link inside it.

    Click that link.

    Fill out the form to create your Slack account.

    Use that Slack account to access dockermastery.slack.com

(I know that's a lot of steps, but since Udemy doesn't give me your email address, I have no way to pre-create you an account on Slack, and Slack is an invite-only system... so the first step is a way for it to auto-generate an invite for you. :)
